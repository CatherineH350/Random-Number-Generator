## Random Number Generator

A function that lets the computer pick a number within a range. 

### Formula
```python
# Import the random library

import random

# Pick a number randomly within a range

variable = random, randit(startNum, endNum)
```

startNum and endNum are inclusive, meaning those numbers are part of the options for the computer to choose from. 

### Rule
Inorder to set a range, check how many options are needed. For example, a coin has 2 sides, s oa coin flipper generator would have 2 options. 

*ex.*
```python
impoer random
coin = random, randit(0,1)

if(coin == 1):
  print("heads")
else:
  print("tails")
```
> head *or* tail
